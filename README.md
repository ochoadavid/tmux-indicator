# tmux-indicator

An ubuntu (unity) indicator to warn about detached tmux sessions in your computer.

I'm a heavy user of tmux in my own laptop and I often accidentally forgot exiting them when sutting down it, sometimes even loosing some of my work. In order to avoid those forgotten sessions I coded this simple indicator, that warns if you have detached sessions.

## Requeriments:

* python-gtk2
* python-appindicator
* sh (pip install sh)

## Installation

Just copy 'tmux-indicator' and 'dtmux' to somewhere in your PATH (eg. ~/bin), mark them as executables and run tmux-indicator on startup.

## Issues, comments, etc.
